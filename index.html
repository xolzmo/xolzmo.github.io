<h1 class="center">Khalil's first website!</h1>

<pre>Hello!My name is Khalil, I am 16 years old.
This is my first time making a website, I hope it does well! 
I have tried coding a few times before, I tried to teach myself using different websites like Khan Academy.
It didn't really work out that well, but I think it would be perfect if somebody taught me!
I would love to learn more about programming here at <a href="https://www.omega365.com/">Omega365!</a>
